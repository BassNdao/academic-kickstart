<!--  What you'll be working on:
• Conducting cutting edge research to develop, implement, and perfect NLP algorithms (NLU, NLG) for text/language/speech processing, understanding, summarizing, and sentiment analysis.
• Applying quantitative techniques to large datasets to obtain actionable insights and execute on them in real time with immediate feedback
• Striving to reach ambitious quantifiable long-term goals, while presenting intermediate achievements
• Staying at the forefront of the newest technologies, prototypes, and being proactive in ML communities
• Coach and mentor team members from a technical perspective.

What is needed for this role:
• Expertise in natural language processing (NLP with NLU), machine learning, deep learning, features engineering, and information extraction from unstructured data.
• Strong knowledge of different deep neural networks architectures (RNN, CNN, GAN, …) with expertise in modeling state-of-the-art seq2seq/Transformers architectures (LSTM) for machine-translation, text summarization, sentences paraphrasing, and time series.
• Expert understanding of data mining techniques, and experience in using well-known frameworks and packages such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Scikit Learn, NumPy and Pandas.
• Expertise with state-of-the-art NLP packages (such as spaCy), open embeddings, transfer learning models and projects (such as BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2, XLNet, sentence-transformers, spacy-transformers / transformers) as well as interpretability techniques.
• Excellent function-oriented, and object-oriented programming skills, especially in Python, and nice to have working experience in Spark, in R, and in SQL and NoSQL DBs and scripting languages.
• Intellectual curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, and innate problem-solving skills with a strong desire to learn, innovate, and continuously challenge yourself.
• A positive, team-focused, results-oriented attitude, and strong collaboration skills
• Excellent written and verbal communication skills to present complex, and cohesive findings in a logical and convincing manner
• 5+ years' experience in conducting ML/NLP projects, and have the ability to build, validate, deploy and monitor iteratively advanced online predictive models -->
