<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->


<!-- Financial data scientists possess a fundamental understanding of all data science skills along with advanced analytical skills, knowledge of the finance industry and the experience of working with financial markets. This position must be able to work with series data and perform data analysis, which means a solid background in statistics, operations, and predictive analytics. In order to work with large amounts of data, most in this position are skilled in R and Python, as well as SQL and NoSQL to retrieve the data from datasets. Many also have a working knowledge of big data technologies such as Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark with the more advanced candidates having skills in machine learning. Additionally, financial data scientists have experience in data cleaning, data munging, as well as domain knowledge. -->

<!-- On the financial side, candidates understand financial planning and analysis that helps them determine actionable insights. Experience in testing time series models and forecasting is also crucial here. In my experience, financial data scientists have worked in the financial arena in some capacity and also have soft skills such as strong leadership and management abilities. While not always, this role typically leads a data science or finance team in some capacity, so the ability to offer professional development to more junior team members is important as well. -->



<!-- Naturally, finance is a field of data, which makes it data dependent. Collection of the data together with the century-old tradition of statistical and mathematical analysis led finance to become an of the early adopters of data science. Thus, combining the finance and data science has paved a way for a new profession called “Financial Data Science”. The astonishing rise of the Data Science application in Finance led someone to call it as “Triumph of Empiricists”. -->

<!-- “Econometrics is measurement in economics … [and] financial econometrics will [consequently] be defined as the application of statistical techniques to problems in finance’  -->

<!-- Long story short, financial data science is basically applying data science techniques to the financial issues. The question here is what are these data science tools? These include data wrangling, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Hence, if you can tackle the financial issues with these tools, you earn to be called as Financial Data Scientist. But is it easy to earn this title? Let’s briefly discuss it now. -->


<!-- Financial data scientist is now an emerging field combining both data science and finance domain. Throughout this reading, you may figure that for those who has neither data science nor finance background, it might take years to have the necessary financial data science knowledge. But if you majored in finance and decided to learn data science or vice versa, then it would a wise way to switch your career as a Financial Data Scientist. -->







<!-- When you combine your knowledge of data analysis and statistical techniques, technology skills to perform the analysis, and the financial domain knowledge, you become a financial data scientist and you are in a position to get the best insights from the financial data.   -->
